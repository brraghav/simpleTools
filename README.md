# simpleTools
This Repository is intended to create and maintain simple Tools that anyone can use without having to code. The tools can be as simple as extracting few keywords from text, but with lot of options and customizations.
Invoking the tools should be as simple as Double Clicking the Python files. Any extra requirements will be mentioned explicitly in the python files itself or an Usage example will be provided.

## Python Modules Installation
pip install PySimpleGUI
